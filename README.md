## Annotation to data:
This project contains data that the user-generated by interacting with the application. There is no external data involved!
Users can create their events by filling out the form. For this process, they must provide information such as Title, date, time, event - cover, type of event, and more. Furthermore, users can upload a profile picture for their account, which is visible to other users.
The application has little data because it is still in the development phase. Please note that some tables and attributes are still missing for the simplicity of the MVP.

# Implemented Security Measures for “Worthsec” - Frontend

# Security Measures Implemented

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**
  - `script-src 'self';`  
    Allows scripts only from the same origin, preventing script injection from unauthorized sources.
  - `object-src 'none';`  
    Blocks embedding of plugins or other potentially unsafe content.
  - `frame-ancestors 'none';`  
    Prevents your site from being embedded in frames or iframes, protecting against clickjacking.
  - *(Planned)* `style-src 'self';`  
    Intended to restrict styles to same-origin, currently disabled due to code issues.

- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**
  - `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`  
    Forces browsers to use HTTPS only for 2 years, including subdomains, with preload enabled.

- **X-DNS-Prefetch-Control**
  - `on`  
    Enables DNS prefetching for improved performance.

- **Referrer-Policy**
  - `strict-origin`  
    Sends only the origin in the Referer header to limit leakage of full URL paths.

- **X-Frame-Options**
  - `DENY`  
    Blocks all iframe embedding to prevent clickjacking attacks.

- **X-Content-Type-Options**
  - `nosniff`  
    Prevents MIME type sniffing, enforcing declared content types.

- **X-XSS-Protection**
  - `1; mode=block`  
    Activates the browser's built-in XSS filter and blocks page rendering if an attack is detected.
